# Userâ€™s Manual of CoInfecProfiler

## Preamble
CoInfecProfiler is a novel tool that reconstructs haplotypes within-host from sequencing data and identifies virus co-infection by combining regularized regression and paired-end linkage. The workflow of CoInfecProfiler is briefed as follows: (A) Mutations are detected by another tool, e.g., GATK. (B) A regression equation is constructed using a reference matrix (which needs to be built by user) and mutations and paired-end linkage information. (C) The frequency of each haplotype is estimated by regularized regression.

## Installation
CoInfecProfiler.jar is a batteries-included JAR executable. All needed external jar packages are included in the downloadable, `CoInfecProfiler.jar`. To download all necessary files, users can use the command `git clone https://github.com/XXX/CoInfecProfiler.git` As we used an R package L0Learn, the users have to install R and L0Learn (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/L0Learn/index.html). The versions of R and R package L0Learn that we have used on our platform are: version 2.1.0 for L0Learn and version 4.3.1 for R. Users are also expected to have java (version: 1.8) on their platform.
Several other tools are prerequisites for running CoInfecProfiler. Users can download and install them from the websites:

- bwa: https://github.com/lh3/bwa
- samtools 1.4: http://www.htslib.org/download/
- GATK 4.3: https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/download/index

## Function
SARS-CoV-2-Reconstruction-VCF: Using SARS-CoV-2-Reconstruction-VCF to reconstruct the haplotypes and their frequency information in the samples.

## Quick start with included example data
Example data is provided in the "Example" folder. After updating absolute paths of executable (such as bwa etc) and parent folder in the param.txt file, users can run CoInfecProfiler by a simple commandline:

### Usage

``` bash
java -jar CoInfecProfiler.jar SARS-CoV-2-Reconstruction-VCF param.txt
```

CoInfecProfiler will output the final haplotype results in the **"output"** folder: `SARS-CoV-2-Variants.txt`
